                            We found each other
                        I helped you out of a broken place
                        You gave me comfort
                        But falling for you was my mistake

                        I put you on top, I put you on top
                        I claimed you so proud and openly
                        And when times were rough, when times were rough
                        I made sure I held you close to me

                        So call out my name (call out my name)
                        Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
                        I want you to stay (want you to stay)
                        I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
                        Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
                        Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?


                        Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
                        Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
                        I'll be on my

                        I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
                        I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
                        Guess I was just another pit stop
                        'Til you made up your mind
                        You just wasted my time

                        You were on top, I put you on top
                        I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
                        And when times were rough, when times were rough
                        I made sure I held you close to me!
